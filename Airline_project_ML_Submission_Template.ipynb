        "The project aims to predict whether a passenger referred by an existing customer will book a flight or not, based on various features such as seat comfort, cabin service, travel class,food beverage , entertainment service, etc. The prediction model is developed using classification techniques in machine learning.The use of machine learning techniques allows for the development of a model that can learn from historical passenger and booking data and make accurate predictions on new data. The model can be used by airlines to target marketing campaigns towards potential passengers who are likely to book a flight based on a referral from an existing customer."

        "In this machine learning project, we evaluated three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, each with its respective performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression demonstrated high performance with an accuracy of 94.5% on the test set and balanced precision and recall values, indicating reliable predictions across classes. The ROC AUC score of 0.945 further supports its robust performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Tree achieved an accuracy of 92.5% on the test set, with good precision and recall scores. However, its performance was slightly lower compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The ROC AUC score of 0.924 reflects its moderate performance in distinguishing between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest outperformed the other models, with the highest test accuracy of 95.7%, precision of 96.0%, and recall of 94.8%. The ROC AUC score of 0.957 indicates its superior ability to discriminate between classes. This model’s robustness is due to its ensemble learning approach, which aggregates multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Random Forest is the most effective model for this dataset, demonstrating the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score. It provides the most reliable and accurate predictions, making it the preferred choice for deployment in practical applications.\n",
